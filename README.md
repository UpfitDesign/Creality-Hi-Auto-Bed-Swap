Thank you for your support! If you'd like to help cover some of the development costs and support future improvements, you can contribute using this payment link. A suggested tip is £20, but any amount is greatly appreciated! Together, we're building better 3D printers.  
I also offer complete hardware kits to build this system. You can source parts yourself or purchase a ready-to-go kit directly from me. Full details, BOM, and instructions are available in the Wiki.
