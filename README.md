# Creality-Hi-Auto-Bed-Swap

The Road to Public Release

We are hard at work perfecting the most reliable, purely mechanical bed swap system for the Creality Hi series. Here is our current development path as we move toward a wide public release on 3D platforms.  

📍 **Phase 1:** Prototype & Community Beta (Current)  
    Mechanical Refinement: Testing the durability of the "Oreo" Marble PLA parts under long-term use.
    Slicer Optimization: Finalizing the "End-Print" G-Code scripts for OrcaSlicer and Creality Print.
    Hardware Kits: Shipping pre-assembled kits from the UK to early adopters to gather real-world data.  

🛠️ **Phase 2:** Reliability & Edge-Case Testing (In Progress)  
    Multi-Material Testing: Ensuring the lever and rear mechanism work flawlessly across different bed temperatures (PLA vs. PETG vs. ABS).
    Fail-Safe G-Code: Developing safety routines that prevent movement if a plate is not detected or improperly seated.
    Print Head Clearance: Fine-tuning the geometry to ensure 100% compatibility with all stock and modified Hi-series cooling ducts.

🚀 **Phase 3:** Documentation & Global Release  
    Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a comprehensive PDF/Video manual for assembly and G-code setup.
    Official Release: Uploading the finalized STL and STEP files to Printables, MakerWorld, and Cults3D for the global community to enjoy.
    Source Code: Opening the full GitHub repository for community-driven improvements.
