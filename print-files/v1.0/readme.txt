Print & Assembly Optimization Notes

To ensure the best assembly experience and part strength, please follow these guidelines when slicing your files:

    Optimized Layout: I have included a recommended layout to ensure the best fit and assembly experience. (3mf file)

    Space Saving: While the recommended layout is optimized for assembly, these parts can be packed onto fewer build plates if you need to save time.

    Standard Tree Supports: All parts are designed and optimized for standard tree supports. These will provide the best surface finish and are printed in PLA.

    Long Parts (Diagonal Placement): For the longer structural components, lay them down diagonally across the build plate to maximize the available space.

    Infill Angle: When placing parts diagonally, remember to change your infill angle (typically to 45° relative to the part) to ensure the internal structure remains strong and aligned with the part's geometry.
